A few days ago, the daughters of two elderly people came to me and mentioned the problem of the elderly's accounts. While being troubled, I mentioned the services that my company can provide. My friend was very happy. He didn't know that such a service existed, and I had such a company. He asked me to provide services for them.

Today, I visited the elderly and asked them about their financial situation. I found that their finances were very confusing. In terms of insurance, the use of credit cards, loan maintenance, and balance of payments, it was just like his daughter, who had a very complicated and chaotic situation. In the early years, it was manageable, but five years ago Chaos began.

I provided suggestions and explanations in various directions, allowing them to withdraw from some insurances at the moment, plan their income use, and plan their daily expenses. As well as planning on how to balance the income and expenses within the year, they were very happy to know that there are these clear ways. And asked me to provide accounting services for their daily accounts.

I am very happy because the elderly are freed from financial worries again.
